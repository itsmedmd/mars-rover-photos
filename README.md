# Mars Rover Photos

A website where you can view the latest images from Mars taken by NASA rovers.

This website uses Server-Side Rendering with NextJS to serve pages for infinitely scrolling masonry gallery,
with data from NASA's ["Mars Rover Photos"](https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api) API
that's periodically fetched for new data that is stored in Amazon DynamoDB in order to achieve the most efficiency
while rendering image gallery pages.
